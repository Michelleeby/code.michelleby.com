I"1<p>What is this site? Besides a sandbox to store solutions to algorithm problems, this is a static website powered by a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>First, the content of this website was designed and organized using relational database principles. Then, it was translated into a Google <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_0Hc7D6VliVqrQkOMZ4MP-cu2j4xwq1q26b8ZBYoUU/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>. Although a spreadsheet is different from a database, when the data is organized using the same principles, it can be interfaced with in similar ways.</p>
