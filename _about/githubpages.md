After Jekyll generates the site files, they are pushed to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/Michelleeby/code.michelleby.com/tree/gh-pages) of this [site's repository](https://github.com/Michelleeby/code.michelleby.com). The main branch of this siteâ€™s repository is what Jekyll uses when it builds locally. The gh-pages branch houses the static files generated by Jekyll that GitHub hosts.
